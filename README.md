## **Introduction**

AI-Doctor RAG is a platform designed to improve post-consultation patient care through the use of advanced **AI Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Patients can chat with an AI version of their doctor to ask questions about their medical reports, schedule appointments, and access healthcare-related financial assistanceâ€”all while ensuring security and privacy for sensitive medical information.

This project addresses the growing demand for more accessible healthcare, especially for underserved or remote communities, by leveraging AI to enhance care continuity and support doctors in managing their workload efficiently.
